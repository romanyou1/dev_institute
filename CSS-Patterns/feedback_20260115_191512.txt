suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML structure provided does not relate to the styling (flexbox or grid) requested in the challenge. The provided HTML creates a structure of nested sections and divs, but it lacks the CSS necessary to arrange them into the pattern displayed in the provided image.
- The HTML lacks the required CSS to create the specified pattern. The main task requires the use of flexbox or grid to style the content.
- Consider adding styling (either inline or within the `style.css` file) to demonstrate the use of flexbox or grid. Without CSS, the HTML structure alone does not fulfill the requirement of recreating the pattern.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements parts of the pattern. The `hero` class uses grid effectively for the overall layout. However, the internal structures are not fully representative of the image asset. Review the asset and ensure complete replication of the arrangement.
- Consider using more descriptive class names than 'box1', 'box2', etc. to improve readability and maintainability.
- The styling could be more concise by using CSS variables for repeated values like colors and border styles.
